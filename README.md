# About Manchester in Real Time
This project is a collaboration between Manchester Evening News and the [BA (Hons) Media & Communication at Birmingham City University](http://www.bcu.ac.uk/media).

On Thursday 9th October a team from BCU visited the Manchester Evening News to put together a data dashboard based on the [model](http://toys.paradisecircus.com/realtime/) developed for [Paradise Circus](http://www.paradisecircus.com/).

The team comprised new media lecturers Nick Moreton and Jon Hickman and final year undergraduates Ross Whitehouse and Lewis Wright (Jon had produced the Paradise Circus dashboard). 

This new dashboard was rebuilt from scratch. It uses a Google spreadsheet to input facts, and then uses Angular JS to present the data.
